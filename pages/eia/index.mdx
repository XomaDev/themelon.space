# Eia 64

Eia64 syntax is heavily inspired by simplicity of Kotlin.

## Binary Operators

Equals `==`, NotEqual `!=`\
GreaterThan `>`, LesserThan `<`\
GreaterThanEquals `>=`, LesserThanEquals `<=`\
Plus `+`, MinusOrNegate `-`, `*` Times, Division `/`\
And `&&`, Or `||`, Bitwise And `&`, Bitwise Or `|`\
BooleanNot `!`\
Increment `++`, Decrement `--`\
Assignment `=`, AddAssign `+=`, ReduceAssign `-=`, TimesAssign `*=`, DivideAssign `/=`

## Data types

Integer `Int`\
Boolean `Bool`\
String `String`\
Character `Char`\
Array `Array`\
Unit (code blocks) `Unit`\
Any `Any`

## Variables

`let` define a constant immutable variable.

```swift
let x = 5
println(x * 5)
```

`var` define a variable mutable to any value or type.

```kotlin
var y = "25"
println(y * 5)

y = "hello world"
println(y)
println(y = 5)
```

Defining a type explicitly.

```swift
let a: Int = 5 * 2
let name: String = "melon"
let aUnit: Unit = { println("hello world") }
let anArray: Array = arrayOf("hello", "world")
println(anArray[0] == "hello")
let someValue: Any = "Hello " + 5
```

### If expression

```kotlin
let x = true
if (condition) { .. } else { .. }
```

```kotlin
if (condition { .. } else if { .. }
```

```swift
if (5 * 5 == 25) { println("Yep!") }
```

#### As expressions

```swift
let a = 5
let b = 7
println(if (a > b) a else b)
```

### Loops

Eia supports three kinds of loops, an `until` loop, an `itr` each and a `for` loop.
`continue` and `break` statements are supported.

#### Until Loop

```kotlin
var i = 0
until (i++ < 5) {
  if (i == 5) break
  println("I is " + i)
}
```

```
I is 1
I is 2
I is 3
I is 4
```

### For each loop

For each loop can be applied on a `String` and `Array` type

#### Iterating through every Char of a String

```kotlin
let text = "cat"
var reconstruct = ""
itr (letter in text) {
  reconstruct += letter
}
```
```
cat
```

#### Iterating on an Array

```swift
let names = arrayOf("France", "Italy", "Germany")
itr (name in names) {
  println(name)
}
```

```
France
Italy
Germany
```

### For Loop

Similar to most programming languages, you can declare a for loop with syntax using\
`for (initializer, coniditonal, operational)` syntax

```swift
let letters = arrayOf('H', 'A', 'C', 'K', ' ', 'C', 'L', 'U', 'B', '!')

for (var i = 1, i < 11, i++) {
  var tillN = ""
  for (var j = 0, j < i, j++)
    tillN += letters[j]
  println(tillN)
}
```

This would output:

```
H
HA
HAC
HACK
HACK
HACK C
HACK CL
HACK CLU
HACK CLUB
HACK CLUB!
```

> Expressions can be empty, e.g.`for (,,) { ... }`

### Native methods

#### Primitive Conversion

`int(String)` String type to Int
`bool(String)` String type to Boolean
`str(Any)` Any type to String

#### I/O

##### Print
`print(Any...)`
`println(Any...`

```kotlin
println("Hello", " World")
```

##### Read

You can use `read()` and `readln()` to read user inputs.

```swift
let aLine = readln()
println("Read line: " + line)
```

> I put my best effort into the language, hope you like it :)

##### General Purpose

`time()` returns time since program startup\
`rand(from Int, to Int)` returns a random number from the range provided\
`len(Any)` returns length of an entity, can be applied on String type, Array type and Unit type.\
`sleep(Int)` sleeps for n millis\
`copy(Any)` creates a copy of that object, only supports String, Int, Bool and Char type.

##### String formatting

You can use `format(String, Any args...)` native method to format your Strings.
This is entirely same as `String.format()` in Java.

```swift
let day = 5
println(format("Today is June %dth", day))
```

Prints `Today is June 5th`

##### Including Std Libs

Eia64 provides a standard library, that is written in Eia itself.
[Check it out](https://github.com/XomaDev/Eia64/blob/main/stdlib).

You can include them using `stdlib(Names...)`

Available classes: `string`, `array`, `math`

```swift
stdlib(array, math)

let nums = arrayOf(2, 4, 6, 8)
println("Average of numbers: " + math.avg(nums))

println(nums.indexOf(4))
```

Output:

```
Average of numbers: 5
1
```

#### Array Operations

You can allocate an array using `arralloc(Int)`


A code demonstrating taking a person's name through `readln()` then converting the read input string into an array of characters.

```swift
print("Enter your name: ")

let personName = readln()
let nameLength = len(personName)

let charactersOfName = arralloc(nameLength)

for (var i = 0, i < nameLength, i++) {
  charactersOfName[i] = personName[i]
}

println(charactersOfName)
```
```
Enter your name: Melon
EArray([M, e, l, o, n])
```

Similarly, you can also change an element in an array e.g. `myArray[xIndex] = 7`

### Functions

Eia functions are declared using the `fn` keyword.\
By default, return type is Any.

```go
fn sayHello(name: String) {
  println(format("Hello %s!", name))
}
sayHello("Melon")
```

#### Function usage

Functions are called using the standard approach:

```go
fn square(x: Int) {
  return x * 2
}
println(square(5))
```

##### Parameters

Function parameters are defined in the format - name: type.

```kotlin
fn powerOf(number: Int, exponent: Int): Int { .. }
```

##### Assignment style

Eia64 supports an inline assignment style body

```go
fn square(n: Int) = n * n
println(square(5))
```

##### Returning

You can simply use the `return` keyword followed by an expression

```swift
fn calculate(x: Int, y: Int) {
 ...
 return result
}
```

#### Units

In most modern languages, you can pass a code block as an argument or store it in a variable.\
You can do that in Eia too! They are called `Unit` types.

```swift
let printRandomNumbers: Unit = {
  let n = rand(0, 9999)
  println("A random number: " + n)
}
printRandomNumbers()
printRandomNumbers()
```

Output:

```
A random number: 5260
A random number: 6186
```

A more complex example:

```swift
var square_result = 0
var n = 0
fn square(upto: Int, callback: Unit) {
  for (n = 0, n < upto, n++) {
    square_result = n * n
    callback()
  }
}

let callback = { println(n + " squared is " + square_result) }
square(5, callback)
```

Output:

```
0 squared is 0
1 squared is 1
2 squared is 4
3 squared is 9
4 squared is 16
```

#### What if you wanted to pass arguments to Units?

Did you know that in recent update Eia supports `shado` units ðŸ‘€\
They are special form of Units that support arguments!\
You can define it same way as Units but using the `shado` keyword.

```swift
let plus = shado(x, y) = x + y
println(plus(2, 3))
```

This prints out `5`.

Passing in arguments"

```swift
let parrot = shado(name) {
  println(format("Hello %s!", name))
  := len(name)
}
println(parrot("Melon"))
```

This outputs:

```
Hello Melon!
5
```

### Guideline(s)

1. Eia64 operates on the principle of referencing, ensuring that data or values are not duplicated unless explicitly requested via the `copy(Any)` method.
Consider this example:

```swift
fn loop(from: Int) {
  for (var i = from, i < 5, i++) { println(i) }
}

let myVariable = 2
loop(myVariable)

println(myVariable == 5)
```

In the example above, function `loop()` takes in an `Int`, and performs iteration.
When `i` was assigned to `from`, the value want copied! It was referenced.

So the output would be `true`.

### Standard Library

Eia standard library consists of `String`, `Array` and `Math` classes.
Codes for standard library is written in Eia64 itself. [Check it out](https://github.com/XomaDev/Eia64/blob/main/stdlib).

#### String

Note that all the functions below when called, do not change the original value, rather creates a new copy.

- `indexOfChar(lookup: Char): Int` index of a character
- `indexOf(substring: String): Int` index of substring provided
- `indexOf(substring: String, from: Int): Int` lookups up index of substring, `from` is the onset.
- `contains(substring: String): Bool` returns if the substring is present
- `startsWith(prefix: String): Bool` starts with `prefix`?
- `endsWith(suffix: String): Bool` ends with `suffix`?
- `uppercase(): String` converts characters to upper case (english alpha only)
- `lowecase(): String` converts characters to lower case (english alpha only)
- `substring(from: Int): String` returns a substring starting `from` onset provided
- `part(from: Int, till: Int): String` returns a substring in the given range
- `replace(match: String, replacement: String): String` replaces all occurrences of `math` with `replacement`
- `repeat(n: Int): String` repeats the string `n` times
- `splitOnce(delimiter: String): Array` splits string into two pieces between `delimiter`, returns an array of two
- `split(delimiter: String): Array` splits string seperated by `delimiter`

#### Array

- `indexOf(element: Any): Int` index of an element in the array
- `contains(element: Any): Bool` true if element is present in the array
- `isEmpty(): Bool` returns if size is 0
- `recursiveLen(): Int` performs a recursive measurement of arrays in array.
E.g.

```swift
stdlib(array)

let x = arrayOf(1, 2, 3, arrayOf(4, 5))
println(x.recursiveLen())
```

The output would be 5.

- `size(): Int` number of elements in the array
- `flatten(): Array` flattens sub arrays into one common array.

E.g.

```swift
stdlib(array)

let x = arrayOf(1, 2, 3, arrayOf(4, 5))
println(x.flatten())
```

It would print `EArray([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])`

- `add(element: Any)` creates a new array with the added element
- `removeAt(index: Int)` creates a new array without the element at the index

#### Math

- `min(a: Int, b: Int): Int` max of two numbers
- `max(a: Int, b: Int: Int` min of two numbers
- `abs(a: Int): Int` abs of int
- `avg(nums: Array): Int`
E.g.

```swift
stdlib(math)

let x = arrayOf(2, 4, 6, 8)
println(math.avg(x))
```

### Cool Stuff

1. Taking in user input and checking if it's admin!

This also demonstrates using the `:=` operator! That helps to return value when there are multiple expressions.

```swift
stdlib(string)

let name = readln()
let admin = if (name.startsWith("Admin")) {
  println("Admin just logged in!")
  := true
} else {
  println("Its just another normal user")
  := false
}

println(admin)
```

Output:

```
> AdminMelon
Admin just logged in!
true
```

2. Creating a function that calculates powers and a result callback.
In the code below, a function `pow()` iterates till `upto` from 0 and powers each `n` to the `power` given.\
After powering, a callback is invoked with the results.

```swift
fn pow(upto: Int, power: Int, callback: Unit) {
    power = copy(power) - 1

    var n_result = 0
    var n = 0
    for (n = 0, n < upto, n++) {
        n_result = copy(n)
        let nCopy = copy(n)

        for (var i = 0, i < power, i++)
          n_result *= nCopy
        callback(n, n_result)
    }
}

let power = 3
let callback = shado(n, result){
  println(format("%d^%d is %d", n, power, result))
}
pow(5, power, callback)
```

This would output:

```
0^3 is 0
1^3 is 1
2^3 is 8
3^3 is 27
4^3 is 64
```
